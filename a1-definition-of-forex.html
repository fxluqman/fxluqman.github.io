    <p><strong>Forex trading</strong>, also known as <strong>foreign exchange trading</strong> or <strong>FX trading</strong>, is the process of buying and selling currencies in the global marketplace. The goal is to profit from changes in the relative value of one currency compared to another. These trades are always made in <strong>currency pairs</strong>, such as <strong>EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar)</strong> or <strong>GBP/JPY (British Pound/Japanese Yen)</strong>.</p>

<p>At its core, forex trading is based on the principle that currencies are constantly fluctuating in value due to economic, political, and market-related factors. Traders speculate on whether one currency will strengthen or weaken against another, and they make profits (or losses) based on those movements.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional stock markets, the <strong>forex market has no central exchange</strong>. Instead, it operates over-the-counter (OTC), meaning that transactions are carried out electronically between participants worldwide, 24 hours a day, five days a week.</p>

<p>Forex trading plays a crucial role in the global economy. Governments, multinational companies, financial institutions, and individual investors all participate in this market for various purposesâ€”ranging from international trade and travel to investment and speculation.</p>

<p><strong>Key characteristics of forex trading include:</strong></p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: Forex is the most liquid financial market, with over $6 trillion traded daily.</li>
 	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Anyone with an internet connection and a small capital can begin trading.</li>
 	<li><strong>Leverage</strong>: Brokers often allow traders to control large positions with relatively small amounts of money, amplifying both potential gains and risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, forex trading is not just about exchanging currencies; it is a fast-moving, opportunity-rich environment that, when approached with the right knowledge and discipline, can offer substantial financial potential.</p>
